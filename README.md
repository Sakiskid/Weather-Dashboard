### Things I learned
- More experience with css and css grid in lieu of Bootstrap
- Creating templates using an initializeElementTemplates() function, clone(), and remove()
- Ended up putting addNewLocation() call into the getCoordsUsingWeatherQuery() function. I had to wait until ajax was done loading before calling the new location, otherwise it would return undefined. Really weird issue that took me a long time to figure out
