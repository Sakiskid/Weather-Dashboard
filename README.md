## Execution:

### Things I learned
- More experience with css and css grid in lieu of Bootstrap
- Creating templates using an initializeElementTemplates() function, clone(), and remove()
- Ended up putting addNewLocation() call into the getCoordsUsingWeatherQuery() function. I had to wait until ajax was done loading before calling the new location, otherwise it would return undefined. Really weird issue that took me a long time to figure out
- Formatting and layout of stylesheet
- Single line if statements dont need squigly brackets
- Better to use `top` instead of `height` for the locationRadioWrappers, because I wanted them to come up like tabs.
- Used sass mixin for pseudoelements
